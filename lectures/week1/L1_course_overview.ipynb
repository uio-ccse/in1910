    "\n",
    "Welcome to [IN1910 – Programming with Scientific Applications](https://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/IN1910/index-eng.html)!.\n",
    "\n",
    "This document covers practical information about the course, its motivation and its structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a brand new course that will be given for the first time the fall semester of 2018. The course can be seen as a follow up to IN1900 and continues the the introduction into the world of scientific programming. We will focus on teaching you important tools and concepts, and the goal is for you to walk away from the course as a competent scientific programmer.\n"

    "### The motivation behind IN1910\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper [*Best Practices for Scientific Computing*](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745) by Wilson, et al, discusses the need for better practicies in the field of scientific computing. They quote recent studies that show scientists typically use 30% or more of their time developing software, but that 90% or more are primarily self-taught. As a result, most are not properly trained in the use of good tools and practicies.\n",
    "\n",
    "A movement called [*Software Carpentry*](https://software-carpentry.org/) is trying to remedy the situation by giving workshops and sharing resources for training researchers in computing and programming. As the name implies, the goal is to give researchers a set of useful *tools* and the competence and confidence to use them properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"fig/software_carpentry.png\" width=200>\n",
    "\n",
    "IN1910 aims to do the same thing. We do not just want to teach you how to code up scientific applications, but we want to give you a set of important tools and practices to program in an efficient manner that leads to more reliable and maintainable code. We will therefore spend time during the course to cover tools such as version control and focus on testing and documenting code."

    "#### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper by Wilson et al goes through and identifies what they think are the most important aspects of scientific computing. Their best practices are outlined as 8 major points.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write programs for people, not computers\n",
    "2. Let the computer do the work\n",
    "3. Make incremental cbhanges\n",
    "4. Don't repeat yourself (or others)\n",
    "5. Plan for mistakes\n",
    "6. Optimize code only after it works correctly\n",
    "7. Document design and purpose, not mechanics\n",
    "8. Collaborate\n",
    "\n",
    "In IN1910, we will return to these practices and try to reflect on how to implement them in our workflow and code.\n",

    "## Languages in 1910\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1910 is a continuation of IN1900, and will primarily be using Python. However, we will also be introducing a second language: C++. \n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a modern, object-oriented programming language. It has a clear, readable syntax, making it easy to learn, and easy to write understandable, maintainable, and shareable code. It also has a good standard library and plenty of extensions for scientific computing. It is also open source. All of this points to Python being a good language for scientific computing. A language that is fairly comparable to Python for some scientific applications is Matlab, but we will also dive deeper into object-oriented programming and other concepts in computer science that are not that well covered by Matlab. Besides, Python has a syntax fairly similar to Matlab, and so learning Python well will equip you to handle Matlab at a later point. We opt to go for Python 3, hopefully you have already taken the move over to 3 yourself, but if you are used to 2.7, don't worry, the differences are minor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we do expect students taking IN1900 to be fairly familiar with Python. If you are not, you should expect to put in more work during the first few weeks of the course. Here, Langtangen is a good resource to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we choose to also include C++, and not just stick to Python? First of all, learning a second language is very helpful on its own. As it helps you generalize programming concepts and not get to attached to a single way of writing code. C++ is a very popular language, and so the chances you will meet or use the language later is high. It is also low-level, compared to Python, which is high-level, and so they have different areas of use. Knowing C++ let's us write more efficient and faster code than Python, with drawbacks we will get back to later. Lastly, C++ is based on C, the most used programming language in the world, and many other languages are inspired heavily on C. Knowing C++ will therefore make using other languages a lot easier (C, Java, C#, objective-C, javascript, etc). Python on the other hand, has a syntax that is quite different from these, and so knowing *only* Python can be restrictive for working with code in other languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The magazine IEEE Spectrum publishes an annual list of programming langues ranked by popularity. The [2018 list](https://spectrum.ieee.org/at-work/innovation/the-2018-top-programming-languages) was published 31st of July. The top ten programming langues (by popularity) are shown in the figure below\n",
    "<img src=\"fig/spectrum_ranking_2018.png\" width=400>\n",
    "The symbols indicate what people often use the languges for, with the globe meaning web, the cellphone mobile, the screen desktop and scientific applications, and the chip embedded applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The spectrum ranking is just one of many rankings, and it doesn't necessarily mean that much. The main reason we bring it up is to point out that knowing Python and a bit of C++ will most likely be very useful if you continue doing *any* kind of programming in your future, be it scientific or other."

    "### Curriculum and Teaching Materials\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not operate with a single book in IN1910, as we are covering many different topics that are not well covered by any existing textbook. The curriculum is therefore defined by what is covered in the lectures. For each lecture, there will be accompying lecture notes covering that week's material. If you are not attending the lectures, you should read/work through the lecture notes. If you do attend lectures, it might be a good idea to skim through the lecture notes before any given lecture, or go through them at your own pace after a given lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the lecture notes, we will give references to external teaching materials that you can use to better learn the materials. These are meant as additional information to those who want it, or alternatives to those who might not like the style or tone of the lecture notes. Note that these secondary materials are just recommendations, and you can choose which of them to use or cover yourself. Most of the materials we recommend will be open source materials freely available online.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a good reference on Python for scientific programming, we recommend *A Primer on Scientific Programming with Python, Fifth Edition av Hans Petter Langtangen*, which many of you taking the course probably already have already. If you do not, you are not required to acquire it.\n",

Here you will also log in with your UiO username and password, and you can then navigate to IN1910. When you run Jupyter notebooks through Jupyterhub, you are running things on a UiO server, so this is a good solution for reading materials if you are on a different computer than your regular computer with everything installed.\n",

You are encouraged to do the projects in pairs, more on this later. In addition to the project work we will have a short oral exam where you will present the work you did in the final project. To get a Passing grade you will need to pass all three projects and the oral exam. If you fail one of the projects, but have delivered some work, we will give you a chance to improve your project and submit again. Along with the project assignments you will get more information about what is required to pass.\n",
